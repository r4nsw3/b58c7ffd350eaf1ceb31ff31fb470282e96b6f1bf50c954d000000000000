  |   Nineteen years after the events of Wolfenstein II, BJ Blazckowicz     |
  |   has disappeared after a mission into Nazi-occupied Paris. Now,        |
  |   after years of training from their battle-hardened father, BJ's       |
  |   twin daughters, Jess and Soph Blazkowicz, are forced into action.     |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Wolfenstein: Youngblood features the most open-ended Wolfenstein      |
  |   experience to date. From a new base of operations located deep in     |

  |                                                                         |
  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.3 (v196608) - Firmware: 9.0.0 / Mkey 7.0.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Patch Highlights                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Adjusted difficulty of all boss fights                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Enemies can now have their health bars toggled on or off in the     |
  |     Options menu. (This does not turn off armor types.)                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Took a variety of actions to reduce the feeling of enemy "bullet    |
  |     sponginess"                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * An amount of ammo for basic weapons is now replenished after a      |
  |     player respawns                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added more special weapon ammo throughout more difficult areas      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added duplicate tutorial laptops to the game to make 100%           |
  |     completion more attainable                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue that could cause some enemies in certain areas to    |
  |     spawn prematurely                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Increased the speed of switching between certain weapons to make    |
  |     it easier to adapt to enemy armor types                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Bug fixes                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Client players can now explode Host player DKW charges by           |
  |     shooting them                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * A data tape required to complete the Silent Outpost mission could   |
  |     go missing, preventing completion of the mission. This tape will    |
  |     now appear correctly for all players                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Equalized damage modifiers for all weapon classes and upgrades      |
  |     for Host and Client players. Previously a bug could cause one       |
  |     player to do a lot more damage with certain weapon types and        |
  |     upgrades                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The "available unlocks" and message could play despite there        |
  |     being active enemies. This will no longer occur                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a variety of timing bugs with completion events that could    |
  |     cause progression not to be saved in certain circumstances          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Co-op levers will now work much more reliably when playing solo     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Improved sister AI so that she gets out of the way of large         |
  |     enemies more often and improved ability to successfully heal the    |
  |     player when they are downed                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Balance changes                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Tutorials not collected by players in Paris Streets sections 1 or   |
  |     2 will now be present in Paris Streets section 3. This will allow   |
  |     players to backtrack from later sections of the game in order to    |
  |     get tutorials that count towards game completion percentage         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added checkpoints to all Tower mission and Tower Guardian fights.   |
  |     Note that returning to the towers after completing the main         |
  |     missions will not have checkpoints                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Players who expend all lives and reset to the latest checkpoint     |
  |     will now find their base weapons refilled to at least 50% of ammo   |
  |     capacity. This will function with all ammo modifier skills and      |
  |     upgrades but does not affect special or heavy weapons               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Additional special weapon ammo has been added to all boss and       |
  |     guardian fights                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * We have doubled the amount of damage done to armored enemies by     |
  |     the incorrect weapon type. This will result in enemies feeling      |
  |     much less absorptive of damage when the player has the wrong        |
  |     weapon equipped. We still highly encourage players to spend their   |
  |     silver to upgrade a variety of weapon types so as to maximize       |
  |     damage to tough enemies                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * General Winkler has had his health lowered to be more in line       |
  |     with the difficulty of the Zeppelin level                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The Bombdog damage has been slightly lowered                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The base Shotgun, Autopistol, and SMG damage output has been        |
  |     increased to bring them in line with other basic weapons            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Tower Gate Guardians have had their level lowered in all            |
  |     Districts to better reflect the level of enemies inside the         |
  |     Towers. The Towers are still intended to be played by players       |
  |     level 20 or higher                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added the ability to toggle "iron sights" on/off. This option can   |
  |     be found in the Controls menu                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added the option to turn off enemy health bars to the Gameplay      |
  |     options. Note that this will not turn off armor barriers or enemy   |
  |     level, so we recommend players have a high degree of familiarity    |
  |     with enemies before turning health bars off                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added more than 20 additional duplicate tutorials to the            |
  |     Districts to allow for easier game completion as well as better     |
  |     coverage for new players                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added a unique icon for Tutorial Computers when player has the      |
  |     correct Secrets Collector upgrade                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Lowered Lothar's healthpoints during the "Penthouse" stage of the   |
  |     boss                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Made a variety of changes to Lothar's accuracy and damage during    |
  |     his final stage                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Added an alarm and audio cue for the 4th Reich jet planes during    |
  |     the Lothar fight to give players more of a chance to dodge or       |
  |     shoot down the planes                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Reduced the number of missiles during the Lothar flight stage       |
  :                                                                         |
